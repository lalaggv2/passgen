Opened a new repo and uploaded files already on my pc

This is the page that greets you when you open the website.

For some reason I put all the commments and pics on something called "Create README.md" but they don't show up when I open this readme.md

this is the link: https://github.com/lalaggv2/passgen/commit/8eb16177f62252e32174a8c406a8b6bd0c59d7cf

So I guess I didn't place the README in the right place.

Hopefully this works and you can see it.

Even though I read the Markdown document, the README format is not clear completely (what should be in it, why is it so restrictive (no cut and paste images and so on).

By the way, what's the CreateREADME? why is it different from the README?
